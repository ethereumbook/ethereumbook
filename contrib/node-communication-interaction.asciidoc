Node Communication and Interaction
----------------------------------

Ethereum defines a set of rules (protocol) in order for the
nodes/clients to communicate and interact with each other. The wire
protocol is used to describe the way information is structured and
transferred between machines. The protocol may be either text-based or a
binary protocol.

Text-based protocols are typically optimized for human parsing and
interpretation, and are therefore suitable whenever human inspection of
protocol contents is required, such as during debugging and during early
protocol development design phases.

A binary protocol is a protocol which is intended to be read by a
machine rather than a human being, as opposed to a plain text protocol
such as IRC, SMTP, or HTTP. Binary protocols have the advantage of
terseness, which translates into speed of transmission and
interpretation.

[[rlpx-binary-protocol]]
RLPx (Binary Protocol)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Ethereum, *peer-to-peer* communication and data transmition is
achieved using the RLPx stack(Devp2p and RLP) which in terms uses a
connection-oriented channel to transfer RLP encoded data.

[[jsonrpc-2.0-plain-text-protocol]]
JSONRPC 2.0 (Plain-text Protocol)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to RLPx, Ethereum provides a Plain-text JSON RPC
request–response protocol which can be used by decentralized
applications(DApps) or clients to **interact with a node**. Requests and
responses are formatted in JSON and transferred over HTTP, Websockets and
IPC.

https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC

JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC)
protocol. Primarily this specification defines several data structures
and the rules around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that
the concepts can be used within the same process, over sockets, over
http, or in many various message passing environments.

[[jsonrpc2.0-http]]
JSONRPC2.0 HTTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go-Ethereum exposes an HTTP server which accepts JSONRPC requests on
port *8545* (default port). The following command runs Go-Ethereum
client with rpc support:

....
$ geth --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcport <portnumber>
....

the `--rpccorsdomain` flag allows browsers to make cross-origin HTTP
request from a different domain, protocol, or port.

[[jsonrpc2.0-websockets]]
JSONRPC2.0 WebSockets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the HTTP server, a WebSockets connection may be established
with the node on port *8546* (default port). Initially a request is sent
to the HTTP server which is later upgraded to the WebSocket protocol
providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP
connection.

....
$ geth --ws --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 --wsorigins "*" --wsport <portnumber>
....

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

[[jsonrpc2.0-ipc]]
JSONRPC2.0 IPC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An IPC socket is a communication channel for exchanging data between
processes executing on the same host operating system. Go-Ethereum
creates a socket (**geth.ipc**) by default which allows any process
running on the host machine to communicate with the node.

[[interacting-with-a-node-through-the-jsonrpc-interface]]
Interacting with a Node through the JSONRPC interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the process to run a private blockchain network
and the interaction with the nodes on the network. The interaction
process can also be applied to a node which runs on a public blockchain
network.

This setup is useful and cost effective for trying out Ethereum and
test/develop DApps built on Ethereum without having to use real Ether.
You either pre-generate or mine your own Ether on the private Ethereum
Testnet.

[[private-ethereum-testnet-setup]]
Private Ethereum Testnet Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.Download and install Geth

Instructions:
https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum

2.Create chain data folder and the genesis block for your private
testnet

....
$ mkdir -p $HOME/testnet/chaindata
$ cd $HOME/testnet
$ nano genesis.json
....

Paste the following content in the `genesis.json` file :

....
{
    "config": {  
        "chainId": 245948721, //random value for your private testnet
        "homesteadBlock": 0,
        "eip155Block": 0,
        "eip158Block": 0
    },
    "difficulty": "0x400",    //low difficulty-level to mine Ether
    "gasLimit": "0x8000000",  //set this really high for testing
    "alloc": {}
}
....

3.Initialize genesis block

....
$ geth --identity "MobinPrivateTestNode" --datadir $HOME/testnet/chaindata init $HOME/testnet/genesis.json
....

4.Run the node with the custom genesis block

....
$ geth --rpc --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpccorsdomain "*" --ws --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 --wsorigins "*" --datadir $HOME/testnet/chaindata --networkid 245948721
....

5.Attaching session to the node using the IPC socket

....
$ geth attach $HOME/testnet/chaindata/geth.ipc
....

6.Create accounts and mine Ethers

....
# Create account
$ personal.newAccount()

# Set the generated address to reward Ethers to
$ miner.setEtherbase(personal.listAccounts[0])

# Start mining
miner.start()

# Wait few minutes
....

Develop apps which call few of the procedures... use different transport
for each of them Need to demonstrate that no magic is done in web3.js,
procedures are simply called in js using the jsonrpc interface

[[jsonrpc-transport-http]]
JSONRPC Transport: HTTP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO: 1. Create a simple client to call the endpoint (js/golang) 2.
Integrate in a web app

[[jsonrpc-transport-websockets]]
JSONRPC Transport: WebSockets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO: 2. Create a simple client to call the endpoint (js/golang) 2.
Integrate in a web app

[[jsonrpc-transport-ipc]]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TODO: 3. Develop a program to communicate with the node over the
unixsocket

[[web3.js]]
Web3.js
+++++++

Explain that web3.js is the js lib which implements the above transports
to communicate with a node and there is no magic ...
