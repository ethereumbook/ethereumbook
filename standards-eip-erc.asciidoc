=== Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md

From EIP-1:

 EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
