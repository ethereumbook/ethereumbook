((("EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)")))((("Ethereum (generally)","EIPs")))((("Ethereum (generally)","standards")))The Ethereum Improvement Proposal repository is located at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/[]. ((("EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals)","workflow")))The workflow is illustrated in <<eip_workflow>>.

From https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md[EIP-1]:

____
EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal. An EIP is a design document providing information to the Ethereum community, or describing a new feature for Ethereum or its processes or environment. The EIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The EIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

| http://bit.ly/2CUf7WG[EIP-20]                | ERC-20 Token Standard. Describes standard functions a token contract may implement to allow DApps and wallets to handle tokens across multiple interfaces/DApps. Methods include: `totalSupply`, +balanceOf&thinsp;(address)+, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`. Events include: `Transfer` (triggered when tokens are transferred), pass:[<span class="keep-together"><code>Approval</code></span>] (triggered when `approve` is called).                                                                       | Fabian Vogelsteller, Vitalik Buterin       | ERC        | Final    | Frontier

| http://bit.ly/2OgE5la[EIP-86]                | Abstraction of transaction origin and signature. Sets the stage for "abstracting out" account security and allowing users to create "account contracts," moving toward a model where in the long term all accounts are contracts that can pay for gas, and users are free to define their own security models that perform any desired signature verification and nonce checks (instead of using the in-protocol mechanism where ECDSA and the default nonce scheme are the only "standard" way to secure an account, which is currently hardcoded into transaction processing).                                                                      | Vitalik Buterin       | Core        | Deferred (to be replaced)    | Constantinople
| http://bit.ly/2QedSFC[EIP-96]                | Blockhash and state root changes. Stores blockhashes in the state to reduce protocol complexity and need for complex client implementations to process the `BLOCKHASH` opcode. Extends range of how far back blockhash checking may go, with the side effect of creating direct links between blocks with very distant block numbers to facilitate much more efficient initial light client syncing.                                                                       | Vitalik Buterin       | Core        |  Deferred   | Constantinople
| http://bit.ly/2AC05DM[EIP-100] | Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time and including uncles. | Vitalik Buterin                            | Core       | Final    | Metropolis Byzantinium
| http://bit.ly/2Jr1zDv[EIP-101] | Serenity Currency and Crypto Abstraction. Abstracts ether up a level with the benefit of allowing ether and subtokens to be treated similarly by contracts, reduces the level of indirection required for custom-policy accounts such as multisigs, and purifies the underlying Ethereum protocol by reducing the minimal consensus implementation complexity. | Vitalik Buterin                            | Active       | Serenity feature    | Serenity Casper
| http://bit.ly/2Q5sdEv[EIP-105] | Binary sharding plus contract calling semantics. "Sharding scaffolding" EIP to allow Ethereum transactions to be parallelized using a binary tree sharding mechanism, and to set the stage for a later sharding scheme. Research in progress; see https://github.com/ethereum/sharding[]. | Vitalik Buterin                            | Active       | Serenity feature    | Serenity Casper

| http://bit.ly/2yJtWZm[EIP-140]   | New Opcode: +REVERT+. Adds `REVERT` opcode instruction, which stops execution and rolls back the EVM execution state changes without consuming all provided gas (instead the contract only has to pay for memory) or losing logs, and returns to the caller a pointer to the memory location with the error code or message.                                                                           | Alex Beregszaszi, Nikolai Mushegian        | Core       | Final    | Metropolis Byzantinium

| http://bit.ly/2CQUgne[EIP-155]                             | Simple replay attack protection. Replay Attack allows any transaction using a pre-EIP-155 Ethereum node or client to become signed so it is valid and executed on both the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains.                                                               | Vitalik Buterin                            | Core       | Final    | Homestead

| http://bit.ly/2qjYJr3[EIP-211]   | New opcodes: `RETURNDATASIZE` and `RETURNDATACOPY`. Adds support for returning variable-length values inside the EVM with simple gas charging and minimal change to calling opcodes using new opcodes `RETURNDATASIZE` and `RETURNDATACOPY`. Handles similar to existing `calldata`, whereby after a call, return data is kept inside a virtual buffer from which the caller can copy it (or parts thereof) into memory, and upon the next call, the buffer is overwritten.

| http://bit.ly/2OgV0Eb[EIP-214]   | New opcode: `STATICCALL`. Permits non-state-changing calls to itself or other contracts while disallowing any modifications to state during the call (and its subcalls, if present) to increase smart contract security and assure developers that re-entrancy bugs cannot arise from the call. Calls the child with `STATIC` flag set to `true` for execution of child, causing exception to be thrown upon any attempts to make state-changing operations inside an execution instance where `STATIC` is `true`, and resets flag once call returns.                                                                        | Vitalik Buterin, Christian Reitwiessner    | Core       | Final    | Metropolis Byzantinium

| http://bit.ly/2RoGCvH[EIP-658]   | Embedding transaction status code in receipts. Fetches and embeds a status field indicative of success or failure state to transaction receipts for callers, as it's no longer possible to assume the transaction failed if and only if it consumed all gas after the introduction of the `REVERT` opcode in EIP-140.

| http://bit.ly/2AAkCIP[EIP-721]                             | ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard. A standard API that allows smart contracts to operate as unique tradable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that may be tracked in standardized wallets and traded on exchanges as assets of value, similar to ERC20. CryptoKitties was the first popularly adopted implementation of a digital NFT in the Ethereum ecosystem.                                     | William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, Nastassia Sachs                            | Standard | Draft    |

An extension of the standard interface ERC20 for tokens with methods that allow the execution of calls inside +transfer+ and approvals. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allowing tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party. Also, it allows the developer to execute calls on transfers and approvals.                                     | Augusto Lemble                            | ERC | Draft    |
| http://bit.ly/2Jq2hAM[EIP-930]                             | ERC930 Eternal Storage. The ES (Eternal Storage) contract is owned by an address that has write permissions. The storage is public, which means everyone has read permissions. It stores the data in mappings, using one mapping per type of variable. The use of this contract allows the developer to migrate the storage easily to another contract if needed.                                     | Augusto Lemble                            | ERC | Draft    |
